      <title>ML Optimizers in JAX</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implementations of some popular optimizers from scratch for a simple model i.e., Linear Regression on a dataset of 5 features. The goal of this project was to understand how these optimizers work under the hood and try to do a toy implementation myself. I also use a bit of JAX magic to perform the differentiation of the loss function w.r.t to the weights and the bias without explicitly writing their derivatives as a separate function. This can help to generalize this notebook for other types of loss functions as well.&lt;/p&gt;
