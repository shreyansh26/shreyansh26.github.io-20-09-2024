               The opening scene starts in the gateroom. The gate is covered 
               and in a corner of the room a group of four military personnel 
               are playing a game of cards.
 
               
               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Oh, man, this hand's as lousy as this 
                         detail. All right, everybody in or out.
 
                         
               
               
               
               One of the personnel deals out some cards.

               
               
               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Seven to the deuce, nothing there, boss 
                         on the eight, nothing happening, queen 
                         to the king, possible straight going 
                         there, eight on the eight, and the jack 
                         gets a box. Eight's open.
 
               
                                     FEMALE
                         Aren't you guys afraid of an officer 
                         coming down here or something?
 
               
                                     OFFICER
                         Trust me. Nobody ever comes down here 
                         but us.
 
               
               
               
               The female Officer notices that the tarpaulin covering the Stargate 
               is fluttering.
 
               
               
               
                                     FEMALE
                         Does that thing always do that?

               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Do what?

               
                                     WOMAN
                         Whatever it is under the tarp! I just 
                         saw it move or do something!
 
               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Probably the only thing it ever did 
                         was cost money.
 
               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Yeah, it looks like they ran out of 
                         that. Been shipping personnel out of 
                         here for months.
 
               
                                     FEMALE
                         I'm telling you, that thing is moving!
 
                         
               
                                     OFFICER
                         If you don't have the straight, just 
                         fold.
 
               
                                     AIRMAN
                         Can we take that as a fold?

               
               
               
               She goes up to take a closer look at the gate, which begins to 
               vibrate
 
               
               
               
                                     FEMALE
                         I take it this has never happened before?
 
                         
               
               
               
               The gate opens and the female officer touches the event horizon. 
               A Jaffa comes through the gate and grabs her. Apophis then comes 
               through.
 
               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Jaffa Kree!

               
               
               
               One of the Jaffa removes his helmet and Teal'c is revealed

               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Teal'c! Kree!

               
                                     WOMAN
                         Get off me!

               
               
               
               Apophis uses the hand device on the woman

               
               
               
                                     OFFICER
                         Let her go!

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Kree Jaffa!

               
                                     SOLDIER
                         Ninety five down here! We need..

               The soldier is shot in the back

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         K'on! A'nsi

               
               
               
               The Jaffa go back through the wormhole. Hammond enters and see's 
               that Apophis has the female officer. He tells the other airmen 
               to hold their fire. Apophis goes through the gate, taking the 
               female with him.
 
               
               
               
               
                                     OFFICER
                         Sir , there's a ladder over here.

               
               Samuel's climbs up the ladder

                                     JACK
                         Retired.

                         I'm Major Samuels.

               
                                     JACK
                         Air Force?

               
                                     SAMUELS
                         Yes, sir. I'm the General's executive 
                         officer.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         A little piece of advice, Major? Get 
                         re-assed to NASA. That's where all the 
                         action's gonna be. Out there.
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         I'm under orders to bring you to General 
                         Hammond, sir.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Never heard of him.

               
                                     SAMUELS
                         He replaced General West. He says it's 
                         important. Has to do with the Stargate.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Jack is taken to the SGC

               
               
               
                                     OFFICER
                         We have to take a second elevator the 
                         rest of the way, sir. It's a long way 
                         down.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         I've been here before.

               
                                     OFFICER
                         Ah. Of course.

               
                                     SAMUELS
                         This way, sir.

               
               
               
               Hammonds Office.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Come.

               
                                     SAMUELS
                         General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Retired.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I can see that. Me? I'm on my last tour.Time 
                         to start getting my thoughts together. 
                         Maybe write a book. You ever think about 
                         writing a book about your exploits in 
                         the line of duty Colonel?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Thought about it. But then I'd have 
                         to shoot anyone who actually read it. 
                         That's a joke, sir. Most of my work 
                         for the past ten years has been classified.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Yes, of course.

               
                                     JACK
                         Major Samuels mentioned something about 
                         the Stargate?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Down to business. I can do that.This 
                         way.
 
               
               
               Jack is shown the body of a Jaffa

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Anyone you know, Colonel?

               
                                     WARNER
                         They're not human.

               
                                     JACK
                         Ya think?

               
                                     WARNER
                         Best we can tell, these slits are actually 
                         a pouch similar to that found in a marsupial.
 
                         
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         Like a kangaroo.

               
                                     WARNER
                         We haven't done an autopsy yet.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         These people ,or aliens, whatever you 
                         want to call them ,came through the 
                         Stargate, killed four of my people and 
                         kidnapped another using advanced weapons.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Weapons, sir?

               
               
               
               He show's Jack a staff weapon

               
               
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         We can't figure out how to operate it.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Jack show's them how it works

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Yes, sir. There were no creatures like 
                         this on Abydos. Those people were human. 
                         From Earth. Ra brought them there thousands 
                         of years ago.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I know all about that. But your report 
                         said this Ra was in fact some kind of 
                         alien that lived inside a human body.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah, his eyes glowed. That was our 
                         first clue.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Are you sure he's dead Colonel?

               
                                     JACK
                         Unless he can survive a tactical nuclear 
                         warhead blowing up in his face, positive. 
                         Why?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         These people ,or whatever they are , 
                         were guarding another man who retreated 
                         back through the Stargate.They got a 
                         good look at his eyes, Colonel. They 
                         glowed.
 
               
               
               
               They walk through the hallway

               
               
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         How do you feel about the Stargate mission 
                         after all this time, Colonel?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         How do you mean?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Well, it's been over a year. Has your 
                         perspective changed?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, sir, I..

               
               
               
               Jack can see Kawalsky and Ferretti in another room.

               
                                     JACK
                         Was that?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Kawalsky and Ferretti, yes. They were 
                         under your command on the first Stargate 
                         mission. Tell me about Daniel Jackson, 
                         Colonel.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Why are they questioning my men?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         They're not your men anymore, Colonel. 
                         You retired. Daniel Jackson?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         You read the report?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Yes.

               
                                     JACK
                         It's all there.

               
                                     SAMUELS
                         Is it?

               
                                     JACK
                         What's this all about, General?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did 
                         you?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel was a scientist. He sneezed a 
                         lot. Basically, he was a geek, sir.
 
                         
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         So you didn't have a lot of time for 
                         him.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         I didn't say that. He also saved my 
                         life and found a way home for my men 
                         and me. A little thing like that kind 
                         of makes a person grow on you, you know 
                         what I mean?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         According to the mission brief, your 
                         orders were to go through the Stargate 
                         to detect any possible threat to Earth 
                         and if found, to detonate a nuclear 
                         device and destroy the Gate on the other 
                         side.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yes.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         But that's not what you did, is it?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Not right away. Ra's forces overpowered 
                         my team and took the weapon before I 
                         could arm it.
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         But with Dr. Jackson's help you eventually 
                         regained control and did in fact detonate 
                         the weapon, yes?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yes.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         So to the best of your knowledge, Daniel 
                         Jackson and everyone else you knew on 
                         Abydos is dead. Correct?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         That's correct.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Good. Then you won't mind if I authorize 
                         a go-ahead on our plan.This quartz material 
                         the Stargates are made of ,it must be 
                         tough stuff if it can withstand a Mark 
                         Three.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, we sent a robot probe through 
                         after we got back, sir. It was flattened 
                         on the other end. Obviously, the Abydos 
                         Stargate had been buried in the rubble.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Gate room.

               
               
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Well, somehow it got unburied.

               
               
               
               A nuclear bomb is about to be sent through the gate.

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Oh my God. Sending another bomb?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Mark Five this time. If these creatures 
                         did reopen the Abydos Gate, we intend 
                         to reseal it for good.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         General, you can't do that.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Countdown's already started. Unless 
                         you have something to add.
 
               
               O'Neill looks at him for a few moments, debating what to do, 
               before coming to stand beside Hammond.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         General Hammond. Sir. I regret to inform 
                         you that my report was not entirely 
                         accurate.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         You didn't detonate the bomb.

               
                                     JACK
                         Oh, I did detonate the bomb, sir. It 
                         was aboard Ra's spacecraft, so it did 
                         kill him and eliminate the risk to Earth.
 
                         
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         However...

               
                                     JACK
                         However, Ra's ship was in orbit above 
                         the planet at the time. Neither the 
                         Gate nor anything else on the planet 
                         was destroyed. Daniel Jackson is alive 
                         and living with the people on Abydos.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         You violated direct orders! Why?

               
                                     JACK
                         Because the people of Abydos are no 
                         threat to us. They deserve to be left 
                         alone.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         That's not up to you.

               
                                     JACK
                         With all due respect, sir, if I'd come 
                         back here and reported the Gate on the 
                         other side was still intact, we would 
                         have sent another bomb just like you 
                         were about to. It wasn't necessary to 
                         let those people die. The threat from 
                         Ra was gone.
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         What about the probe we sent through? 
                         It was crushed instantly.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         After we came home, Daniel buried the 
                         Gate in rocks, making my return or anybody 
                         else's impossible.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Well, those four bodies lying in the 
                         infirmary say otherwise, Airman. We'll 
                         send the bomb through on schedule.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         General, you can't do that!

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Oh, I can't?

               
                                     JACK
                         There are innocent people on that planet!
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         There are innocent people here! I have 
                         my orders too, Colonel. I obey mine. 
                         Take Colonel O'Neill to the holding 
                         room. Let's give him some time to think 
                         about things while I decide what to 
                         do with him.
 
               
               
               
               Jack is escorted out of the room. He is taken into a cell, holding 
               Kawalsky
 
               
               
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Colonel O'Neill, sir.

               
                                     JACK
                         I'm retired, Kawalsky. Lose the salute.
 
                         
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         I appreciate that.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Hey, those kids on Abydos saved my life 
                         too.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah... the kids.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         They're the whole reason we kept the 
                         secret. Right?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         That one kid idolized you. Remember 
                         him? Weird name. What was it?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Skaara.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Right. Remember how he was always saluting 
                         you?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah. My kid used to do that when he 
                         was little. Skaara kind of reminded 
                         me of him.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Oh, man, Colonel. You and me went through 
                         that whole mission together. I never 
                         even knew you had a son.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, he died. Just before the Abydos 
                         mission.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         I'm sorry, sir. I had no idea.

               
               
               
               Hammond enters the room.

               
               
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         How many people did you say are on Abydos?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         That we saw? Maybe five thousand. Does 
                         this mean you're reconsidering sending 
                         the bomb, sir?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         It means I'm open to suggestions.

               
                                     JACK
                         General, let me take a team through 
                         that Gate. We'll find out who those 
                         aliens are. Kawalsky and I have been 
                         there before. We know the lay of the 
                         land, we know the people.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         You think you do. Jackson could be dead. 
                         You don't know what you'd be walking 
                         into.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Sir. There is one way to find out.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Right. We'll have that prototype probe 
                         shipped from M.I.T.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         General, we don't need that probe.
 
                         
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         We don't?

               
                                     JACK
                         Nope. This'll do.

               
               
               
               He picks up a box of tissues and heads to the gateroom. The gate 
               dialling sequence begins
 
               
               
               
               
               
                                     HARRIMAN
                         Chevron 4, encoded!

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Care to explain this concept?

               
                                     HARRIMAN
                         Chevron 5, encoded!

               
                                     JACK
                         Jackson has allergies.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         I get it.

               
                                     JACK
                         He'll know this came from me and not 
                         from someone, with all due respect, 
                         sir, like yourself.
 
               
                                     HARRIMAN
                         Chevron 6, encoded! Chevron seven locked.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Jack goes up the ramp and throws the box of tissues through the 
               event horizon
 
               
               
               
                                     HARRIMAN
                         The object should reach final destination 
                         in five seconds, four, three,two, One.
 
                         
               
               
               
               The wormhole disengages

               
               
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Now what?

               
                                     JACK
                         Now we wait. If Daniel's still around, 
                         he'll know what the message means.
 
                         
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         What if the aliens get it?

               
                                     JACK
                         Well, they could be blowing their noses 
                         right now.
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         They could be planning an attack.

               
                                     JACK
                         Oh, come on, Samuels. Let me be the 
                         cynic around here, okay? Sir, this could 
                         take some time.
 
               
               
               
               They wait in the briefing room. Some time later the gate is activated 
               from offworld. They rush down to the gateroom. A box comes through 
               the wormhole. Jack picks it up and brushes it off. Written on 
               the side, are the words, 'Thanks, send more'
 
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Permission to take a team through the 
                         Stargate, sir.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Assuming I get the President's authorization. 
                         The mission briefing will be at 0800 
                         hours. Consider yourself recalled to 
                         active duty, Colonel.
 
               
               Briefing room

               
               
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Gentlemen, take your seats. Where's 
                         Captain Carter?
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         Just arriving, sir.

               
                                     JACK
                         Carter?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I'm assigning Sam Carter to this mission.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         I'd prefer to put together my own team, 
                         sir.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Not on this mission, sorry. Carter's 
                         our expert on the Stargate.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Where's he transferring from?

               
                                     SAM
                         She, is transferring from the Pentagon.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Sam enters the room

               
                                     SAM
                         I take it you're Colonel O'Neill. Captain 
                         Samantha Carter reporting, sir.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         But of course you go by,Sam.

               
                                     SAM
                         You don't have to worry, Major. I played 
                         with dolls when I was a kid.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         G.I. Joe?

               
                                     SAM
                         No. Major Matt Mason.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Oh.Who?

               
                                     FERRETTI
                         Major Matt Mason, astronaut doll. Did 
                         you have that cool little backpack that 
                         made him fly?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Let's get started. Colonel?

               
                                     JACK
                         Thank you. Those of you on your first 
                         trip through the Stargate, you should 
                         be prepared for what to expect.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         I've practically memorized your report 
                         from the first mission. I'd like to 
                         think I've been preparing for this all 
                         my life.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         I think what the Colonel is saying is, 
                         have you ever pulled out of a simulated 
                         bombing run in an F-16 at 8-plus Gs?

                         : Well, it's way worse than that.

                         By the time you get to the other side, 
                         you're frozen stiff like you've just 
                         been through a blizzard. Naked.

                         That's a result of the compression your 
                         molecules undergo during the millisecond 
                         required for reconstitution.

                         Oh, here we go, another scientist. General,

                                     HAMMOND
                         It means she is smarter than you are, 
                         Colonel. Especially in matters related 
                         to the Stargate.

                         Colonel, I was studying the Gate technology 
                         for two years before Daniel Jackson 
                         made it work and before you both went 
                         through. I should have gone through 
                         then. But sir, you and your men might 
                         as well accept the fact that I am going 
                         through this time.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, with all due respect, Doctor.

                         It is appropriate to refer to a person 
                         by their rank, not their salutation. 
                         Call me Captain, not Doctor.

                         Captain Carter's assignment to this 
                         unit is not an option, it's an order.

                         I'm an Air Force officer just like you 
                         are, Colonel. And just because my reproductive 
                         organs are on the inside instead of 
                         the outside, doesn't mean I can't handle 
                         whatever you can handle.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Oh, this has nothing to do with you 
                         being a woman. I like women. I've just 
                         got a little problem with scientists.

                         Colonel, I logged over 100 hours in 
                         enemy airspace during the Gulf War. 
                         Is that tough enough for you? Or are 
                         we going to have to arm wrestle?
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         I hate to throw a damper on your enthusiasm, 
                         but I still say the safest, most logical 
                         way to deal with this is to bury the 
                         Stargate just like the ancient Egyptians 
                         did. Make it impossible for the aliens 
                         to return. It's the only way to eliminate 
                         the threat.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Except it won't work.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         It worked before.

               
                                     JACK
                         They know what we are now. They know 
                         how far we've come. We're a threat to 
                         them. They've got ships, General. Ra 
                         had one as big as the Great Pyramids. 
                         They don't need the Stargate to get 
                         here. They can do it the old-fashioned 
                         way. Now with all due respect to Mr. 
                         Glass Is Half Empty over here, don't 
                         you think we should use the Stargate 
                         to do a little reconaissance before 
                         they come back, again?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I'll give you exactly 24 hours to either 
                         return or send a message through. No 
                         Kleenex boxes, please.Otherwise, we'll 
                         assume the worst and send a bomb through.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Understood.

                         Try to follow orders this time, Colonel.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Sir?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         This time you bring Daniel Jackson back. 
                         Is that clear?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yes, sir.Move out!

               
               Kawalsky and Ferretti go through the stargate. Sam stares at 
               the wormhole.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Captain?

               
                                     SAM
                         Don't worry, Colonel. I won't let you 
                         down.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Good. I was gonna say Ladies first.
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         You know, you really will like me when 
                         you get to know me.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Oh, I adore you already, Captain.

               
                                     SAM
                         My God, look at this. The energy the 
                         Gate must release to create a stable 
                         wormhole is astronomical, to use exactly 
                         the right word. You can actually see 
                         the fluctuations in the event horizon.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Jack pushes her through the wormhole, then follows

               
               Abydos

               
               They arrive inside a small pyramid. Sam doesn't look well

                         Oh... I think I'm going to be sick.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Maybe you shouldn't have had that big 
                         lunch.
 
               
               
               
               They begin to check out the area. Suddenly some boys appear and 
               point guns at them.
 
               
               Daniel appears

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Cha'hari! Cha'hari! Lower your guns.
 
                         
               
               Jack looks at Daniel.

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Jack? Welcome back.

               
               
               
               Jack walks towards Daniel, but ignores him and continues towards 
               Skaara

                                     SKAARA
                         O'Neill. I did not think to be seeing 
                         you again!
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel, how you doing?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Good. You?

                         Much better, now that I see that everybody's 
                         okay.

                                     DANIEL
                         So, I figured it would be a matter of 
                         time before you had to tell the truth 
                         about us still being here.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah.Why the militia? Something else 
                         come through?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No, we're just taking precautions. Why?

                         Amazing. This is what was missing from 
                         the dig at Giza. This is how they controlled 
                         it. It took us 15 years and 3 superconductors 
                         to MacGyver a system for the gate on

               Jack looks first at Sam and then at Daniel. She gets the hint 
               and shakes hands with him.

                                     DANIEL
                         What's going on, Jack?

               
                                     JACK
                         Six hostile aliens came through the 
                         Stargate on Earth. Four people are dead, 
                         one's missing.

                         : One of them looked like Ra, Daniel.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Well, they didn't come from here. I 
                         mean, the boys take shifts guarding 
                         it 36 hours a day. Every day. We'd know 
                         if they came through here.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, they came from somewhere, Daniel. 
                         I'm going to have to look around.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I think I can help you find out who 
                         it was, but, uh, it's going to have 
                         to wait til this sandstorm is over. 
                         Uh, we were about to have our evening 
                         meal. Why don't you join us?
 
               
               
               
               The Abydonians and the team, share a meal.

                         What's this?

               
                                     SKAARA

                                     JACK
                         Yeah. Moonshine, as in booze. Daniel, 
                         what are you teaching these kids?

                         Alright. Skaara's moonshine. Give it 
                         a little shot.
 
               
               
               
               He drinks some and spits it out

                         Yeah, I'm so proud. Whoa.

               
                                     SKAARA
                         O'Neill. Your lighter?

                         No, it's yours. I gave that to you to 
                         keep. Remember?
 
               
               
               
               Skaara leaves

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         You know, he's never let that out of 
                         his sight the whole time you were gone.

                                     DANIEL
                         So this man who looked like Ra, he must 
                         have come through another Gate.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         What other Gate?

               
                                     JACK
                         A Stargate?

               
                                     SAM
                         Stargate only goes here.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         I think you're wrong about that.

               
                                     SAM
                         I was there. We ran hundreds of permutations.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         But you didn't have what you need.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel, what are you talking about?
 
                         
               
               Skaara returns

               
                                     SKAARA
                         Daniel. The storm has passed.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         I'll show you. Sha're. Ben' ra' ki, 
                         Jack,vili tau an.
 
               
                                     SHA'RE
                         Bonni'wa?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         I won't be long.

               
               Sha're kisses him

               
                                     SHA'RE
                         Goodbye, my Daniel.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Bye.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Hold the fort.

               
                                     FERRETTI
                         Yes, sir.

               
               
               
               They leave the pyramid and have to put on sunglasses to protect 
               their eyes from the suns glare. All around is desert and they 
               make their way to another structure
 
               
               
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Boy, I can't say I missed this place.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Come on.

               
                                     SAM
                         This is just incredible.

               
               They enter the structure

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         So, I figured that there had to be more 
                         to this place, so I started exploring, 
                         um, this area around the town and the 
                         pyramid at first. And after about a 
                         month, I found this place. Captain Doctor, 
                         you're going to love this.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Oh, my God. This is amazing. This is 
                         the archaeological find of the century.
 
                         
               
               
               
               The room and walls are filled with what appear to be gate addresses
 
               
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel, you had a chance to translate 
                         this yet?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I think so.

               
                                     JACK
                         What's it say?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Well, it doesn't say anything. Actually, 
                         it's sort of a chart, more of a map.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Of?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Well, I haven't been able to analyze 
                         all of it. I mean look at it. It would 
                         take my whole life.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, Daniel, we don't have that long. 
                         What's it a map of?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Well, the cartouches seem to be separated 
                         clearly into groupings. Each grouping 
                         is attached to the others by a series 
                         of lines, and each grouping contains 
                         seven symbols, so you can see where 
                         this is going, of course.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Tell us anyway.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         All of the symbols are on the Stargate 
                         in the Abydos chamber. I've also managed 
                         to chart some of them in the Abydos 
                         sky, or at least pretty close. Jack, 
                         I think this is a map of a vast network 
                         of Stargates, Stargates that are all 
                         over the galaxy.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         I don't think that can be, Doctor.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Why not?

               
                                     SAM
                         Well, because after Colonel O'Neill 
                         and his team came back, my team tried 
                         hundreds of symbol permutations using 
                         Earth as the point of origin, and it 
                         never worked.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Well, I tried the same here and it didn't 
                         work either. But I figured the destinations 
                         I tried are either destroyed or... buried, 
                         but some of them somewhere must still 
                         exist.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         I don't think so.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Then where did your Ra lookalike come 
                         from? I don't pretend to know anything 
                         about astrophysics, but couldn't the 
                         planets change? I mean, drift apart 
                         or something like that to throw this 
                         map off?
 
               
                                     SAM
                         I knew I'd like you.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         You mean I'm right?

               
                                     SAM
                         According to the expanding universe 
                         model, all bodies in the universe are 
                         constantly moving apart.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         So in the thousands of years since the 
                         Stargate was built -
 
               
                                     SAM
                         All the co-ordinates could have changed.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         But why does it still work between Abydos 
                         and Earth?
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Abydos is probably the closest planet 
                         in the network to Earth. I mean, the 
                         closer they are, the less the difference 
                         in relative position due to expansion. 
                         The further away, the greater the difference.In 
                         a few thousand more years, it won't 
                         work between Earth and Abydos either.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Unless you can adjust for the displacement.
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         Right. Now with this map as a base, 
                         that should be easy. All we have to 
                         do is correct for Doppler shift. Then 
                         I should be able to arrive at a computer 
                         model that will predict the adjustments 
                         necessary to get the Gate working again.
 
                         
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Okay. So what did we just figure out?
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         Any civilization advanced enough to 
                         build this Gate network would be able 
                         to compensate for 50,000 years of stellar 
                         drift.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         So, the Stargate can go other places.
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         The aliens could have come from anywhere.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Sha're, Skaara, Ferretti and the other Abydonians are around 
               the gate area.
 
               
               
               
                                     FERRETTI
                         Man, you've got to give Daniel credit. 
                         She's one beautiful woman.
 
               
               
               
               The Gate activates

               
               
               
                                     SOLDIER
                         We've got company, boys! Move! Move! 
                         Take cover!
 
               
               
               
               Serpent Guards come through the gate and begin firing their staff 
               weapons. Many people are being shot and killed. Ferretti is wounded. 
               Apophis comes through the gate.
 
               
                                     SKAARA
                         Sha're! Sh'im rota! Sh'im rota!

               
               A Serpent Guard grabs Sha're

               
                                     SHA'RE
                         No!

               
               Skaara tries to attack,but Teal'c grabs him

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         This is not your weapon. Where did you 
                         get it?
 
               
               
               
               Skaara spits in his face.

               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Good choice, Teal'c. A perfect specimen.
 
                         
               
               
               
               He uses the hand device on him and he collapses

               
               
               
                                     SHA'RE
                         Daniel! Daniel! Skaara! Skaara!

               
               
               
               Apophis grabs her

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         You may be the one.

               
               
               
               He uses the ribbon device on her and the gate is opened. Ferretti 
               is badly injured but manages to see the address. Daniel and the 
               others return.
 
               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Sha're! Sha're!

               
               He goes to an Abydonian boy

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Bolah!

               
                                     BO'LA
                         There were so many. So many of them.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         It's all right. Just tell me what happened.
 
                         
               
                                     BO'LA
                         It was Ra.

               
                                     JACK
                         What's going on?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Ra is dead. Tau'pa Ra!

               
                                     BO'LA
                         No, Ra. I saw. He took Sha're. He took 
                         Skaara into the chaapa'ai.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Did you see? Did you see?

               
                                     JACK
                         What's going on, Daniel? Could there 
                         be another Ra?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         How the hell should I know? Should have 
                         left the barricade up. This is my fault.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Come on. Come on.

               
                                     SAM
                         Colonel, Ferretti needs medical attention 
                         now!
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Go! Help him! I can send you back.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         You're coming with us this time, Daniel. 
                         I've got orders.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I don't care about your orders, Colonel. 
                         My wife is out there. So is Skaara.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         And the only way we're gonna get 'em 
                         back is if you come home with us. Ferretti 
                         might have seen those coordinates. Captain, 
                         do you have the video?
 
               
                                     SAM
                         I got everything I need.

               
                                     FERRETTI
                         Too many.

               
               Daniel calls the Abydonians to him

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Lea. Lea.

               
               They gather around him

               
                                     DANIEL
                         After we go through the chaapa'ai, you 
                         have to bury it like we did before and 
                         then leave this place.
 
               
                                     BOY
                         You come back?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         No. I can't. Nobody can, that's what 
                         I'm telling you. Not for a... long time. 
                         Now as soon as we're gone, I want you 
                         to close it. Bury it. Put a big heavy 
                         cover stone over it. Nothing good could 
                         ever come through this Gate, do you 
                         understand me?
 
               
                                     BOY
                         You came through it, Daniel.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Do you remember the story I told you? 
                         How the ancient Egyptians on Earth cut 
                         themselves off from Ra? Well, that is 
                         exactly what you have to do. Then in 
                         one year, one year from this day you 
                         take the cover stone away. I will try 
                         to bring Sha're home with me on that 
                         day, but if I don't make it back, if 
                         I don't, if I don't return then you 
                         must bury the Gate again forever. Cha'qua?
 
                         
               
               Daniel is crying

               
                                     DANIEL
                         You tell Sha're's father, one year.
 
                         
               
               They all hug him and he finally moves away to dial up the gate

               Daniel, Jack and the others come through the gate, dragging the 
               wounded soldiers

                         That's our insurance against any more

                         impenetrable.

                         What happened, Colonel?

               
                                     JACK
                         Base camp was hit while we were on recon, 
                         sir.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Same hostiles who attacked us?

               
                                     JACK
                         That's a fair guess. Jackson's wife 
                         and one of our kids was kidnapped.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND

                         From the previous mission, sir.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         General, hi. Daniel Jackson. I'd like 
                         to be on the team that goes after them.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         You're not in any position to make demands, 
                         Jackson.
 
               
               Chulak

               
               The Abydonians are in a large dungeon. Teal'c appears to be in 
               charge. He points at Sha're
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Chal'noc. Her.

               
               They grab Sha're and Skaara rushes towards them

               
                                     SHA'RE
                         Skaara! Skaara! No!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Your death cannot help her.

               
                                     SHA'RE
                         I am not afraid of you!

               
               She is taken out of the dungeon and Skaara slumps by the cell 
               doors
 
               
               SGC Infirmary. Kawalsky is sitting by Ferretti's bed

               
                                     JACK
                         Doc says he's gonna make it.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Guess so.

               
                                     JACK
                         You gonna stay here all night?

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Yes, sir.

               
               O'Neill leaves and is about to go home, when he see's Daniel 
               standing up against a wall in the corridor
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Hey.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         They don't know what to do with me, 
                         and I don't know what to do with myself.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Come on. Let's get out of here.

               
               Jack's house. He gets some beer out of the fridge and hands one 
               to Daniel. Daniel sneezes into a tissue
 
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Nice catch.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Thank you. Sorry. Gate travel always 
                         seems to make my allergies......
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Tell me about her.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         She was the complete opposite of everyone 
                         else. She practically fell on the floor 
                         laughing every time I tried to do some 
                         chore they all took for granted, like 
                         grinding yafeta flour. I mean, have 
                         you ever tried to grind your own flour?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         I'm trying to kick the flour thing.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         This is going straight to my head. What 
                         time is it anyway? I must have Gate 
                         lag or something.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel for crying out loud, you've had 
                         one beer. You're a cheaper date than 
                         my wife was.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Yes, when am I going to meet your wife?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Oh probably never. After I came back 
                         from Abydos the first time, she'd already 
                         left.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I'm sorry.

               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah so was I. I think in her heart 
                         she forgave me for what happened to 
                         our kid, she just couldn't forget.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         And what about you?

               
                                     JACK
                         I'm the opposite. I'll never forgive 
                         myself. But sometimes I can forget. 
                         Sometimes.

                         Where are you taking me? I'm a sergeant 
                         in the U.S. Air Force. I demand to know 
                         where you're taking me. Let go!

               He looks at her

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Lovely. Full of life.

               
               He uses the hand device. She is stripped and put on the table

                                     APOPHIS
                         Yes. Yes. Very nice indeed. But I am 
                         not the one you must finally please.
 
                         
               
               A female Jaffa comes over and reveals her pouch. A symbiote appears.
 
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Does she please you my love?

               
               The symbiote goes back into the pouch

                         A shame.

               The ribbon device is used for a second time. This time the officer

                                     HAMMOND
                         People, what's spoken of in this room 
                         is classified as SCI top secret. Colonel, 
                         what do we know about these hostiles 
                         that we didn't know yesterday?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Not a hell of a whole lot General. The 
                         Abydonian boys who survived the attack 
                         on the base camp thought it was Ra.
 
                         
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I thought he was dead. Gentlemen which 
                         is it?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Oh, he's dead, he's definitely dead. 
                         I mean the bomb I mean, he's got to 
                         be dead, right?
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Then who's coming through the Stargate?
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Gods.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         What?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Not as in God, god. Ra played a god, 
                         the sun god. He borrowed the religion 
                         and culture of the ancient Egyptians 
                         he brought through the Gate, and then 
                         he used it to enslave them. You see, 
                         he wanted the people of Abydos to believe 
                         that he was the only one.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         So you're saying Ra's not the last of 
                         his race after all?
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Maybe he's got a brother Ray.

               
                                     JACK
                         That's all we need.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Wait a minute. The legend goes, Ra's 
                         race was dying. He survived by taking 
                         over the body of his human host, an 
                         Egyptian boy. But who's to say more 
                         of his kind couldn't do the same thing? 
                         I mean it could happen any time, anywhere 
                         there's a Gate, I mean, this could be 
                         happening right now.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Colonel, you've had the most experience 
                         in fighting this hostile. Assuming you'd 
                         have to defend yourself in the field, 
                         are you up to it?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         We beat them once.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I'll take that as a maybe. Captain Carter, 
                         you're confident that the Stargate will 
                         take us where we want to go with this 
                         new information?
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Well, they're feeding the revised co-ordinates 
                         into the targeting computer right now. 
                         It'll take time to calculate, but it 
                         should spit out two or three destinations 
                         a month.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         People, let's not fool ourselves here. 
                         This thing is both fast and dangerous, 
                         and we are so far over our heads we 
                         can barely see daylight. We would all 
                         be much better off if the Stargate had 
                         been left in the ground.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         With respect, sir, we can't bury our 
                         heads in the sand. I mean think of how 
                         much we could learn. Think of what we 
                         could bring back.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         What you could bring back is precisely 
                         what I'm afraid of, Captain. However, 
                         the President of the United States happens 
                         to agree with you. In the event your 
                         theories pan out, he has ordered the 
                         formation of nine teams, whose duties 
                         will be to perform reconnaissance, determine 
                         threats and if possible, to make peaceful 
                         contact with the peoples of these worlds. 
                         Now, these teams will operate on a covert 
                         top secret basis. No one will know of 
                         their existence except the President 
                         and the Joint Chiefs. Colonel O'Neill?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Sir?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Your team will be designated SG-1. The 
                         team will consist of yourself, Captain 
                         Carter
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         And me?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Dr. Jackson, we need you to work as 
                         a consultant with the other SG teams 
                         from here. Your expertise in ancient 
                         cultures and languages are far too valuable 
                         to
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No. Look, I mean I know this is your 
                         decision, but I just, I really have 
                         to be on their team. My wife is out 
                         there General. I need to go.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         I'll take that under consideration. 
                         Major Kawalsky, you will head SG2.
 
                         
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : I will?

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Colonel O'Neill keeps telling me it's 
                         about time you had a command.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         I had a moment of weakness.

                                     JACK
                         Ferretti. I know you're probably not 
                         feeling so hot, but we need something 
                         from you.

                         Colonel, I'd like to remind you that 
                         rescuing Dr. Jackson's wife is a secondary 
                         objective. In the event you fail to 
                         notify base camp within 24 hours SG-2 
                         will scrub the mission and return without 
                         you.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Understood.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Not gonna happen Colonel. SG2 won't 
                         leave without you.
 
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         All right, let's confirm transmitter 
                         codes. Remember, only the right code 
                         will open the iris and if you lose your 
                         transmitter you cannot get home.
 
               
                                     SAM
                         Understood, sir.

               
                                     HAMMOND
                         SG1 and SG2, if you do not return within 
                         24 hours your remote transmitter codes 
                         will be locked out and the iris will 
                         be sealed permanently. At that point 
                         there will be no return. Is that understood?
 
                         
               
                                     JACK

                         with you.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Yeah. I'm kind of glad you're staying

                         Okay, people, let's get the gear out! 
                         Let's move!
 
               
               Daniel sneezes.

               Teal'c goes back into the Dungeon and this time picks Sha're 
               out
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         You.

               
                                     SHA'RE

               Back at the gate

               
                                     DANIEL
                         It must be some sort of ceremonial place. 
                         The Gate has to be a part of their spiritual 
                         culture. I'd say this place was built 
                         for worshippers.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well let's just try to be out of here 
                         before the worshipees show up, huh? 
                         You figured out yet how to align this 
                         Gate to get back home?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah. The device is the same as on Abydos. 
                         This symbol represents....
 
               
                                     JACK
                         You brief Kawalsky's team yet?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Yes. This symbol represents....

               
                                     JACK

                         Sir, I found what looks like a trail 
                         in the mountains. Looks like it hasn't 
                         seen traffic in a couple of days.

                         We could set up a line of claymores 
                         along that ridge at ten meter intervals.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Sound about right, Kawalsky?

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Yeah that'll work.

               
               
               
               Sha're is taken to Apophis' room

               
               
               
                                     SHA'RE
                         No!

               
               Apophis enters

               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Come.

               
                                     SHA'RE
                         No! No, no! Aah!

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         This one has spirit.

               
               
               
               The ribbon device is used on her and her clothe are removed. 
               She wakes up, as the symbiote comes out of the Jaffa woman's 
               pouch.
 
               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Does she please you, my love?

               
               
               
               The symbiote is crawling over her body. Sha're is put on her 
               stomach and the symbiote enters her neck.
 
               
               Back at the gate

                         : This looks like a good spot right 
                         up here!
 
               
                                     JACK
                         All right. If we're not back in twenty 
                         hours
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : We'll come rescue your sorry asses.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Negative. You'll go back through the 
                         Gate with the combination Daniel gave 
                         you before the iris is locked so you 
                         can't go back.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Yes sir.

               
                                     JACK
                         Hold down the fort.

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : Pick me up a t shirt.

               
               
               
               The team head off towards Apophis' base

               
               
               
                                     SAM
                         So, Dr. Jackson, tell me about Sha're. 
                         How did you meet?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Oh, Sha're. Well, she's......

               
                                     JACK
                         She was a gift.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         She was actually from the elders of 
                         Abydos the first time we were there.
 
                         
               
                                     SAM
                         And you accepted?

               
                                     JACK
                         Hold up.

               
               There are some men approaching.

               
                                     JACK
                         C'mon.

               
               The team hides, but Daniel stands up and goes to the natives.
 
               
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         All right Captain. Take your position 
                         fifty yards
 
               
               
               
               Jack see's that Daniel is gone

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Oh, for crying out loud. The man hasn't 
                         changed.
 
               
               
               
               Daniel stops in front of the men

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Hi.

               
               
               
               Jack and Sam come out and point their guns at the men

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         We just came through the Stargate. The

               The men start bowing

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No, please don't do that...

               
                                     JACK
                         Friends of yours?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Unless we want to give ourselves a bad 
                         reputation, I think we should avoid 
                         shooting the first people we meet on 
                         a new planet. Oh, please, you don't 
                         have to do this.

                         Lasla . Choose! They want to know if 
                         we're here to choose.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         What the hell.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Sure. We can choose. Choosing is good. 
                         It's a derivation of Arabic combined

                                     JACK
                         Yeah, yeah. All right, whatever. Just 
                         ask them to take us to the nearest village.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Um, would you take us to, um arish. 
                         Arish?
 
               
                                     NATIVE
                         Yah, ala, Chulak.

                         Chulak. Sounds good.

               
                                     JACK
                         I hear it's nice this time of year.
 
                         
               
               
               
               They go to the city

               
               They enter a room which holds a large table, where lot's of people 
               are seated. The team sit at the head of the table.
 
               
               
               
                                     SAM
                         Why are they treating us like this?
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         They think we're gods.

               
                                     JACK
                         Ok. We're gods. Now what?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         I have no idea.

               
               
               
               A horn sounds and the people bow down low. Daniel copies them.
 
               
               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         When in Rome.

               
               
               
               Apophis enters the room and Sha're is beside him, dressed in 
               royal robes
 
               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Behold! Your queen.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Sha're.

               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Kneel before your queen.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Sha're, it's me.

               
               Sha're is a Goa'uld. Apophis uses the ribbon device to fling 
               Daniel back against the wall. Jack stands and points his gun 
               at Apophis. Sha're stands in front of him. Jack is hit from behind
 
               
               
               Back at the SGC

                         Once we seal the iris we could still 
                         get a transmission from our team.

                         Yes, sir. But we couldn't be sure it's 
                         not the aliens or one of our own people 
                         under duress of torture. Sealing the 
                         Stargate is the best.....

                                     DANIEL
                         Sha're.

               
                                     SAM
                         Easy. You've been unconscious for hours.
 
                         
               
                                     DANIEL
                         No. I saw her.

               
                                     SAM
                         I know. We all did.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         I saw Sha're. She was...

               
               He stands up

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         If there's a way out of here I haven't 
                         found it yet. But, look what I did find.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Skaara appears

               
                                     SKAARA
                         Daniel! You're okay.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Yeah, I think so.

               
                                     JACK
                         Easy big guy. Welcome back to the land 
                         of the conscious.
 
               
                                     SKAARA
                         O'Neill told me about Sha're.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Jack, help me. We can find her again.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel. If we can't find a way out of 
                         here, the missions a bust anyway. They 
                         seal the Gate in just over ninety minutes. 
                         Come on Skaara. Let's find our way out 
                         of here.
 
               
               
               
               Teal'c grabs his arm and is staring at his watch

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         What is this?

               
                                     JACK
                         It's a watch.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         This is not Goa'uld technology. Where 
                         are you from?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Earth.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Your words mean nothing. Where are you 
                         from?
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Excuse me.

               
               
               
               Daniel draws a symbol on the ground

               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         This is where we're from.

               
               
               
               Teal'c wipes away the symbol

               
               Back at the camp

               
               
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Warren, let's go! Rise and shine! The 
                         sun is... suns, are coming up. We're 
                         going to be all right.
 
               
                                     WARREN
                         We can't go through another night like 
                         that, Captain!
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Yeah, gets a little chilly on this planet 
                         at night. Colonel should have sent us 
                         a radio message by now.
 
               
                                     WARREN
                         When do you have to make the decision? 
                         Whether or not to go back to the Stargate?
 
                         
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         That'll be about when hell freezes over.
 
                         
               
                                     WARREN
                         I think that pretty much describes our 
                         current situation.
 
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         We are not leaving here without the 
                         Colonel. Is that understood? Another 
                         fine day on Planet Kawalsky
 
               
               
               
               Back in the dungeon

               
               
               
                                     SAM
                         So Ra isn't dead after all.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         It wasn't Ra. It was Apophis.

               
                                     SAM
                         Who?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         It's from Egyptian mythology. Ra was 
                         the sun god who ruled the day, Apophis 
                         was the serpent god, Ra's rival, who 
                         ruled the night. It's right out of the 
                         Book of the Dead. They're living it.
 
                         
               
                                     SKAARA
                         We will save Sha're?

               
                                     JACK
                         I can't promise you anything at the 
                         moment.
 
               
                                     SKAARA
                         But you're a great warrior! We defeated 
                         Ra together!
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Yeah, yeah, I know, but take a look 
                         around here. Look at what we're up against.We'll 
                         try.
 
               
               
               
               Jaffa enter the room. Teal'c stands on the steps

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Sha'ka ha! Kree hol mel, Goa'uld!

               
                                     JACK
                         What did he say?

               
                                     SKAARA
                         They are going to choose.

               
                                     SAM
                         Choose what?

               
                                     SKAARA
                         Who will be the children of the gods.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Apophis and Sha're are carried into the room, on a litter

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Jaffa!

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Sha're.

               
               
               
               Jack and Sam grab him before he can draw attention to himself
 
               
               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         Jack, help me, please...

               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel, don't. Don't.

               
               
               
               More Goauld move into the room

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Bena! Ya'wan, ya'duru! Kneel before 
                         your masters!
 
               
               
               
               Sam, Jack and Daniel are kneeling. Skaara is still standing
 
               
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Skaara.

               
               
               
               Skaara kneels

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Benah! Ya'wan, y' duru! Choose!

               
               
               
               They look at a little girl

               
               
               
                                     GOA'ULD
                         No.

               
               
               
               They examine another girl

               
               
               
                                     GOA'ULD
                         This one. We choose this one.

               
               
               
               More Goa'uld continue looking. Daniel rushes up to them. He is 
               held by two Jaffa. Jack tries to help, but staff weapons are 
               pointed at him
 
               
               
               
                                     GOA'ULD
                         This one's passionate.

               
                                     DANIEL
                         How much would I remember if you chose 
                         me?
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Daniel, what are you doing?

               
                                     DANIEL
                         Something of the host must survive.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Teal'c looks at Jack and shakes his head

               
               
               
                                     GOA'ULD
                         We choose...

               
               
               
               He looks at Skaara

               
               
               
                                     GOA'ULD
                         Him.

               
               Skaara is taken

               
               
               
                                     SKAARA
                         Na'ney! Na'ney! O'Neill!

               
                                     JACK
                         Skaara!

               
                                     SKAARA
                         O'Neill! O'Neill!

               
                                     JACK
                         Skaara!

               
               
               
               Jack is hit

               
               
               
                                     SKAARA
                         O'Neill! O'Neill!

               
               
               
               As the Goa'uld leave. Apophis turns to Teal'c

               
               
               
                                     APOPHIS
                         Kill the rest.

               
               
               
               The rest of the captives begin screaming and running. Jack shouts 
               to Teal'c
 
               
                                     JACK
                         I can save these people!

               
               Teal'c points his staff weapon at O'Neill.

               
                                     JACK
                         Help me! Help me.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Many have said that!

               
               
               
               He fires at one of his own Jaffa

               
               
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         But you are the first I believe could 
                         do it!
 
               
               
               
               A firefight ensues, with the team and teal'c getting the upper 
               hand
 
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Get out of the way!

               
               
               
               A hole is blown in the wall

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Come on! Let's move!

               
               The captives go out through the hole

               
                                     SAM
                         Come on! Come on! Go! Move! Let's go! 
                         Come on! Go! There you go! Go! Come 
                         on!
 
               
               Jack, Daniel and Teal'c are left

               
                                     JACK
                         You going to be okay?

               
               Daniel doesn't answer him, and climbs through the hole. Jack 
               turns to Teal'c
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Hey, come on!

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I have nowhere to go.

               
                                     JACK
                         For this you can stay at my place. Let's 
                         go!
 
               
               He follows him out

               
                                     JACK
                         What's your name?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         Teal'c.

               
               The are walking through the tree's, heading for the gate

               
                                     JACK
                         Teal'c, where will they take Skaara? 
                         The boy?
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         To the Stargate. After they've selected 
                         hosts for their children, they will 
                         return home.
 
               
               
               
               The SGC

               
               
               
                                     SAMUELS
                         Sir, they have just under an hour until 
                         the deadline. We should have heard from 
                         them by now.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         A lot can happen in an hour, Major.
 
                         
               
               
               
               Jack and the others head to the gate

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         We've got less than an hour. How we 
                         doing?
 
               
                                     SAM
                         We lost a few when we got to the forest.
 
                         
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         They will be hunted down and killed. 
                         Anyone who does not exist to serve the 
                         gods is their enemy
 
               
                                     JACK
                         And that makes you...?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         I am a Jaffa. Bred to serve so that 
                         they may live.
 
               
                                     DANIEL
                         I don't understand.

               
               
               
               Teal'c show's them his symbiote

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         What the hell is that?

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         It is an infant Goa'uld, the larval 
                         form of the gods. I have carried one 
                         since I was a child, as all Jaffa carry 
                         one.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         Well, get it out of there.

               
                                     TEAL'C
                         In exchange for carrying the infant 
                         Goa'uld into maturity, a Jaffa receives 
                         perfect health and long life. If I were 
                         to remove it, I would eventually die.
 
                         
               
                                     JACK
                         Hell, if I were you, I'd take my chances.
 
                         
               
               A Goa'uld transport vessel is above the gate

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         All right, come on, people, let's go. 
                         Let's move!
 
               
                                     TEAL'C
                         The boy you seek is no longer who he 
                         was.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         I don't want to hear that.

               
               
               
               Skaara is ringed down, followed by Apophis and Sha're

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Take cover!

               
               A ship begins firing at the ground.

               
               
               
                                     SAM
                         Colonel, we're sitting ducks here!
 
                         
               
               
               
               Apophis activates the gate. A missile is launched at the ship, 
               which is destroyed
 
               
               
               
               Apophis and Sha're go through the gate. Jack turns to see Kawalsky 
               on a hilltop.He was obviously responsible for destroying the 
               Goa'uld ship
 
               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Kawalsky

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Yeah!

               
                                     JACK
                         Come on, folks!

               
               Kawalsky comes down to Jack

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         Great shot! How many are there?

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         A dozen. Maybe more. They're headed 
                         back through the Gate.
 
               
                                     JACK
                         What about Skaara?

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         : He's with them.Colonel, we don't have 
                         much time before they lock us out. Warren! 
                         Casey! On my right!
 
               
               
               
               Jack takes his first look at the Stargate

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         No.

               
               Skaara is about to go through the gate

               
               
               
                                     JACK
                         No.

               
               Jack heads to the gate

               
               
               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Colonel! Sir!

               
                                     JACK
                         Skaara!

               
               
               
               Skaara turns to look at O'Neill

                         Colonel O'Neill? Care to explain?

                         We can use the Stargate to send these 
                         people home, sir.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         What's he doing here?

               
                                     JACK
                         General Hammond. This is Teal'c. He 
                         helped us.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         Do you know what he is?

               
                                     JACK
                         Yes, sir. I do. He's the man who saved 
                         our lives. And if you accept my recommendation, 
                         sir, he'll join SG-1.
 
               
                                     HAMMOND
                         That decision may not be up to you.

               Kawalsky isn't well

               
                                     JACK
                         You all right?

               
                                     KAWALSKY
                         Yeah, I'm good.

                         All right. Let's get these people situated.
 
                         
               
               
               
               SG1, including Teal'c are by the gate. Daniel turns to look at 
               it
 
               
               
               
                                     DANIEL
                         She's out there somewhere, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         We find them.

               
               
               
               The team leave the ramp, and we see Kawalsky. His eyes are glowing.
